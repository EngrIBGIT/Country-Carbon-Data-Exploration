# Country Carbon Data Analysis

## Overview
This project explores carbon emission and removal dynamics across countries, focusing on understanding how forest cover, deforestation rates, and above-ground carbon stocks influence global emissions. The analysis uses data from 2001 to 2022 to extract insights into how different countries contribute to global carbon flux.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Filtered the data for 30% tree cover density and removed duplicate entries.
- **Carbon Emissions vs. Removals**: Calculated the emission-to-removal ratio to identify countries with the highest disparities between carbon output and sequestration.
- **Emissions Trends**: Analyzed deforestation and emission trends over the years to highlight countries with the highest increase and decrease in emissions.
- **Visualizations**: Interactive charts showing top emitters, countries with high emission-to-removal ratios, and trends in emissions change.

## Visualizations

## Insights
1. **Carbon Stock Distribution**: Africa leads in above-ground carbon stock per hectare, emphasizing the need to preserve forests in high-density regions.
2. **Emission-to-Removal Ratios**: Countries like Swaziland and Cambodia have disproportionately high emission-to-removal ratios, signaling the need for targeted interventions.
3. **Global Trends**: Thereâ€™s a clear trend where countries with higher forest cover tend to both store more carbon and emit more, highlighting the dual role of forests in both storing and releasing carbon through deforestation or degradation.

## Future Directions
Further analysis could involve:
- Deep dives into country-specific carbon policies.
- Exploring the impacts of forest management practices on carbon dynamics.
- Forecasting emissions using machine learning models.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and install the necessary libraries from `requirements.txt`. Then, run the notebook to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
